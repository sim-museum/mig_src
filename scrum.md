# Scrum — Native Linux Port of Mig Alley

> **Epic:** *Complete the port of Mig Alley to Linux.*
>
> This repository (`/home/m/ma`, branch `linux-port`) is the **Mig Alley** native Linux
> (SDL2) port of the 1999 Rowan engine. The epic is: **take the native 32-bit ELF build
> from its current state (first 3D frame rendered) to a fully playable, shippable game with
> no Wine dependency.** The runtime is built on the reused `bob_*` engine glue
> (`bob_main` / `bob_init_instance` / `bob_run` / `g_pBobApp` / `bob_video` …), shared with
> the sibling Battle of Britain port.

---

## 1. Product Vision

> *For* flight-sim enthusiasts and preservationists *who* want to run Mig Alley on modern
> Linux without Wine/DirectX, *the* native SDL2 port *is a* self-contained 32-bit ELF build
> *that* renders, simulates, and plays the full game (2D front-end, 3D flight, campaign,
> audio) at native speed *unlike* the emulated Wine path, which is fragile and non-native.

**Product Goal (this release train):** A reliably launchable build where a user can start
the app, navigate the menus, configure preferences, and fly a mission to completion with
working controls and audio — all native.

## 2. Scrum Framework Setup

| Element | Value |
|---|---|
| **Product Owner** | Repository maintainer (`curator`) |
| **Scrum Master** | Rotating / lead engineer |
| **Developers** | Porting engineer(s) + automated agent (Claude) |
| **Sprint length** | 2 weeks |
| **Estimation** | Story points (modified Fibonacci: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21) |
| **Velocity (assumed)** | ~20 pts/sprint (re-baseline after Sprint 1) |
| **Backlog tool** | This file (`scrum.md`) + git history as the audit trail |

### Ceremonies
- **Sprint Planning** — start of each sprint; pull from top of Product Backlog into the Sprint Backlog up to capacity.
- **Daily Scrum** — async standup; 3 questions captured as a one-line commit/log note.
- **Sprint Review** — demo the *shippable increment* (run the binary, show the new capability).
- **Sprint Retrospective** — append a short note to the relevant phase in `CLAUDE.md` / memory `migalley-port-state`.
- **Backlog Refinement** — mid-sprint; re-estimate, split stories that proved too big.

### Definition of Ready (DoR)
A story is ready when it has: a clear user-value statement, acceptance criteria, a rough estimate, and no unresolved blocking dependency.

### Definition of Done (DoD)
A story is done when:
1. Code compiles clean into the unity/MFC/OLE build set (`port/rebuild.sh`).
2. `wmig` links to a 32-bit ELF with **0 undefined symbols**.
3. The capability is demonstrated by running the binary from the Wine data dir
   (`BOB_RUN_INIT=1 BOB_DRIVE_C=<drive_c> ./wmig`) — not just compiled.
4. No regression in previously-passing phases (title screen, Preferences, first 3D frame).
5. Relevant gated trace (`MA_TRACE_*`) added for any new subsystem.
6. `CLAUDE.md` status + memory note updated; change committed on `linux-port`.

## 3. Release Plan (Increments)

> **PO-accepted first-release target: R2 — Flyable 3D** (ratified Sprint 1 planning, 2026-06-17).
> The train can stop earlier, but the PO's first *formal acceptance* gate is R2. A brief
> increment review happens at each Sprint Review; formal accept/ship decision at R2.

| Release | Theme | Sprints | Shippable outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| **R1** | Stable launch & front-end | 1–2 | Deterministic boot to title + Preferences; persistence to disk |
| **R2** ⭐ | Flyable 3D *(PO accept gate)* | 3–5 | Reliable 3D flight with input control, visually A/B-correct |
| **R3** | Immersion | 6–7 | Audio + video (Smacker) + HUD/cockpit complete |
| **R4** | Full game | 8–9 | Campaign / mission management playable end-to-end |
| **R5** | Polish & ship | 10 | Packaging, controls config, performance, docs — v1.0 |

Each release is a usable product; the train can stop at any release boundary and ship.

## 4. Product Backlog (ordered by value/risk)

> Status legend: ✅ done (baseline) · 🔨 in progress · ⬜ not started

### EPIC A — Runtime stabilization *(highest priority: nothing else is reliable without it)*

| ID | User Story | Pts | Acceptance Criteria | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | As a player, I can launch into 3D flight **every time** without intermittent crash/window-close, so the game is dependable. | 13 | 20/20 consecutive launches reach the cockpit view; no SIGSEGV/SIGFPE; 3D-startup races (sim thread vs `MakePassive`/`View3d::Drawing`) hardened. | ✅ **20/20** (S1) |
| A2 | As a player, my Preferences persist across runs, so I don't reconfigure each launch. | 5 | `Save_Data` written to disk on exit; reloaded on next boot; round-trip verified. | 🔍 code-complete (S1); live demo blocked by env |
| A3 | As a maintainer, the build is reproducible from one command, so onboarding is trivial. | 3 | `port/rebuild.sh` + documented link line yields `wmig` from clean tree; 0 undefined symbols. | ✅ (maintain) |
| A4 | As a maintainer, startup race conditions are diagnosable, so regressions are caught fast. | 3 | Thread-ordering invariants asserted/logged under `MA_TRACE_3D`; a stress-launch harness script in `port/`. | ✅ `port/stress_launch.sh` (S1) |

### EPIC B — 3D flight fidelity

| ID | User Story | Pts | Acceptance Criteria | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | First native 3D frame renders the flight view. | 8 | Cockpit view: sky/horizon/terrain/HUD; ~95% back-surface coverage; crash-free single frame. | ✅ |
| B2 | As a player, the rendered scene matches Wine output, so visuals are correct. | 13 | A/B frame capture (`MA_DUMP_BACK`) vs Wine within tolerance for ≥3 representative views; color/palette correct. | ⬜ |
| B3 | As a player, the 3D view animates smoothly during flight, so it feels like a sim. | 8 | Sustained ≥30 fps over a 60s flight; no tearing/stale-buffer artifacts; 2D present correctly gated off in-3D. | 🔨 |
| B4 | As a player, the cockpit/HUD instruments read correctly, so I can fly on instruments. | 8 | HUD elements (airspeed, alt, heading) render and update with sim state. | ⬜ |

### EPIC C — Input

| ID | User Story | Pts | Acceptance Criteria | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | As a player, I can fly with keyboard via DirectInput→SDL, so controls work in 3D. | 13 | Pitch/roll/yaw/throttle + view keys mapped SDL→engine; responsive in flight. | ⬜ |
| C2 | As a player, I can use a joystick, so flight is natural. | 8 | SDL game-controller/joystick axes→flight controls; deadzone/calibration. | ⬜ |
| C3 | As a player, mouse navigation works across all menus, so the UI is complete. | 5 | Click/hover hit-testing on all front-end panels (extends current listbox/button/combo). | 🔨 |

### EPIC D — Audio

| ID | User Story | Pts | Acceptance Criteria | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | As a player, I hear sound effects, so flight is immersive. | 13 | Miles `AIL_*` stubs → SDL audio mixer; engine/gunfire/UI SFX audible. | ⬜ |
| D2 | As a player, I hear music/ambient tracks. | 5 | Streaming/looped audio via SDL; volume honors Sound prefs. | ⬜ |

### EPIC E — Video (Smacker)

| ID | User Story | Pts | Acceptance Criteria | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | As a player, intro/briefing Smacker videos play, so cutscenes work. | 13 | `Smack*` stubs → real decode (libsmacker) → `ma_ddraw_present`; introsmack plays on title launch. | ⬜ |

### EPIC F — Front-end completeness

| ID | User Story | Pts | Acceptance Criteria | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | Title screen + Preferences render and persist natively. | 21 | title.bmp + interactive settings; tab nav; click-to-change; writeback. | ✅ |
| F2 | As a player, combo boxes show a real dropdown list, not cycle-on-click. | 5 | Dropdown renders options; selection sets value. | ⬜ |
| F3 | As a player, the RESOLUTIONS combo is populated, so I can pick a mode. | 5 | HW display-mode enumeration → combo entries. | ⬜ |
| F4 | As a player, all front-end screens (not just Preferences) are usable. | 13 | Campaign/QuickMission/Comms panels render and navigate. | ⬜ |

### EPIC G — Campaign / mission

| ID | User Story | Pts | Acceptance Criteria | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | As a player, I can start a Quick Mission and fly it to completion. | 21 | Mission load → 3D flight → end-of-mission; no crash. | ⬜ |
| G2 | As a player, I can play the campaign across missions, so the game is complete. | 21 | Campaign state load/save; mission chaining; debrief. | ⬜ |

### EPIC H — Ship

| ID | User Story | Pts | Acceptance Criteria | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | As a user, I can install and run without manual env vars, so it's distributable. | 8 | Launcher resolves data dir; packaged artifact; README run instructions. | ⬜ |
| H2 | As a user, I can rebind controls, so the game fits my setup. | 5 | Controls screen writes a remappable bindings file consumed by C1/C2. | ⬜ |
| H3 | As a maintainer, the port is documented for contributors. | 3 | `PORTING.md` + `scrum.md` reflect final architecture. | 🔨 |

**Backlog total (open work): ~250 pts** → ~10–12 sprints at re-baselined velocity.

## 5. Sprint Plan (rolling)

### 🏃 Sprint 1 — "Dependable launch" (R1) — ✅ PLANNED & RATIFIED (PO, 2026-06-17)
**Sprint Goal:** The game launches to 3D flight reliably and remembers my settings.
**Committed (capacity ≈ 20 pts, 21 committed):** A1 + A2 + A4. Live board: `port/scrum/sprint-01.md`.

| ID | Story | Pts | Tasks |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Harden intermittent 3D launch | 13 | (1) Instrument sim-thread vs main-thread startup order under `MA_TRACE_3D`. (2) Add barrier so `DoMoveCycle`/`body2screen` never run before `MakePassive` finishes surface+matrix init. (3) Guard `View3d::Drawing()` gate. (4) Run 20× stress-launch; log pass rate. |
| A2 | Persist `Save_Data` to disk | 5 | (1) Locate writeback path. (2) Serialize on clean exit + on panel `PreDestroyPanel`. (3) Reload on boot. (4) Round-trip test (change Gamma → restart → still High). |
| A4 | Stress-launch harness | 3 | `port/stress_launch.sh` looping `wmig` with timeout + crash classification. |

**Increment:** A build that boots to a flyable 3D frame on every launch and persists Preferences. Demoable.

### Sprint 2 — "Front-end finished" (R1→R2 bridge)
Stories: F2 (combo dropdown, 5), F3 (resolutions enumeration, 5), C3 (full menu mouse coverage, 5), F4 start (13, may split).
**Increment:** Complete, navigable native front-end across all settings screens.

### Sprint 3 — "Hands on the stick" (R2)
Stories: C1 (DirectInput→SDL flight controls, 13), B3 (smooth animated 3D, 8 — finish).
**Increment:** Fly the aircraft with the keyboard in a live 3D view.

### Sprint 4 — "Looks right" (R2)
Stories: B2 (A/B fidelity vs Wine, 13), B4 (HUD instruments, 8 — start).
**Increment:** Visually-correct flight view with working primary instruments.

### Sprint 5 — "Natural controls" (R2)
Stories: C2 (joystick, 8), B4 finish (8), H2 (control rebinding, 5).
**Increment:** Joystick-flyable sim with rebindable controls — **R2 ships**.

### Sprint 6–7 — "Sound & vision" (R3)
Stories: D1 (SFX, 13), D2 (music, 5), E1 (Smacker video, 13).
**Increment:** Immersive build with audio + cutscenes — **R3 ships**.

### Sprint 8–9 — "Play the game" (R4)
Stories: G1 (Quick Mission, 21), G2 (campaign, 21).
**Increment:** End-to-end playable missions & campaign — **R4 ships**.

### Sprint 10 — "Ship it" (R5)
Stories: H1 (packaging, 8), H3 (docs, 3), buffer for polish/bugs.
**Increment:** Installable v1.0 with no manual env vars — **R5 / v1.0 ships**.

## 6. Burndown / Tracking

Track per sprint (fill in at review):

| Sprint | Committed pts | Completed pts | Velocity | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 21 | 16 (+~3 of A2) | ~16–19 | A1 (13) ✅ 20/20, A4 (3) ✅, A2 (5) code-complete; A2.4 live demo carried to S2 (env wedge) |
| 2 | — | — | — | + carry A2.4 re-demo; planned: F2/F3/C3/F4 |

Re-estimate the backlog and re-slice sprints after Sprint 1 establishes real velocity.

---

## 7. Risks & Mitigations (Product Owner watch-list)

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| 3D-startup races deeper than expected (A1) | Blocks whole R2 train | Time-box investigation; add explicit thread-ordering barriers; mine BoB sibling port for the same fix. |
| HW display-mode/3D path diverges from Wine | Fidelity gap (B2) | Keep `MA_DUMP_BACK` A/B harness as the regression gate. |
| Miles/Smacker have no clean Linux replacement | Audio/video slip | Use libsmacker / SDL_mixer; keep stubs so gameplay (R2/R4) never depends on D/E. |
| 32-bit toolchain / packed-struct fragility | Build breakage | DoD requires 0-undef link every story; never relax `-fpack-struct=1`. |
| Scope creep into editor/multiplayer | Delays v1.0 | Out of scope for this epic; park in a future backlog. |

---

## 8. Out of Scope (parking lot for future epics)
- Multiplayer (DirectPlay→native networking)
- Mission editor tooling
- 64-bit port
- Modern renderer (Vulkan/hardware path beyond current GL present)
